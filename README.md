# Applied Cryptography
Summary of the Applied Cryptography course given by professor Silvio Ranise. University of Trento 2022/2023. 
If you are really interested in the topic you are adivised to read the book [A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography](https://toc.cryptobook.us/) By Dan Boneh and Victor Shoup as the course is heavily inspired by it and this project contains some parts of it.

## Creating the pdf
After cloning the repository, just go inside and type the command `pdflatex -output-directory=./build Principal.tex`. Always run the command twice. It will print a large number of warnings, but we don't worry about those. If you don't want to build it yourself you can find it in [here](https://github.com/IvanValentini/Applied_Cryptography/blob/master/build/Principal.pdf).
