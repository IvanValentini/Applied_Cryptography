\section{Introduction}

Integrity: The receiver can check if the message has been tampered with. Also the receiver can check if the message received is truly from the source I think it is and this becomes a problem of authentication.



Base of all cryptography algorith lies in the secrecy of keys, not the algorithm.

P: set of plaintexts
C: set of ciphertexts
enc: P->C
dec: C->P

dec(enc(m)) = m for every m in P

There is a problem with this formalization: these two functions, must be kept secret. These function can be used to create a secure channel, but how do you share these function? We need a secure channel, but if we had a secure channel, why not use it in the first place!

The wayout is to have functions that use as input a key, so a parametric function, so that for the same plaintext and different keys, we get a different ciphertext. So the function can be public, completly transparent, and we need to protect only keys.
